## Why PyCI?
PyCI is a versatile, free, and open-source Python 3 library designed for setting up and executing arbitrary determinant CI (Configuration Interaction) and FanCI (Fan Configuration Interaction) computations. This library is your gateway to efficiently generate arbitrary sets of Slater determinants and construct selected CI wave functions through intuitive Python scripting.

### Key Features:
1. Flexible CI Computations: Seamlessly set up and run arbitrary determinant CI and FanCI computations with ease.
2. Python Scripting: Construct CI wave functions through Python scripting, allowing for unprecedented flexibility and control.
3. FanCI Wave Functions: Build arbitrary FanCI wave functions by implementing overlap functions and gradients into a well-defined Python interface.
4. Efficient Multi-threading: PyCI leverages a core C++ library with multi-threading capabilities for optimized (Fan)CI computations.
5. ENPT2 Energy Correction: Compute second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory (ENPT2) energy corrections effortlessly.
6. RDM Calculations: Calculate spin-polarized one- and two-electron (transition) Reduced Density Matrices (RDMs) of wave functions.
