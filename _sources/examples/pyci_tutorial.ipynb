The package also supports the use of the restricted and generalized Hamiltonians (unrestricted Hamiltonians can be constructed as a special case of generalized Hamiltonian). These features, combined with routines to control the type of configurations added, according to their excitation level or seniority, allows the user to easily program any CI method.\n",
